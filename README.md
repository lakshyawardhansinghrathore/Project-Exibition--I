# Project-Exibition--I
A machine learning–based crop recommendation system 
# 🏥 Health Care Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## 📖 Project Description
This project is a **Health Care Recommendation System** developed using **Machine Learning** as part of **Project Exhibition – I**.  
The system analyzes patient symptoms and health-related parameters to recommend possible health conditions and provide basic guidance.  
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in the healthcare domain for academic and learning purposes.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project was provided internally for academic purposes and is not publicly available.  
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the full dataset is **not included** in this repository.

A small sample dataset (`sample_data.csv`) is included to demonstrate the structure and format of the original dataset.

### Dataset Details
- Target column: `diseases`
- Input features: Symptom-based features
- Feature values:
  - `0` → Symptom absent  
  - `1` → Symptom present
